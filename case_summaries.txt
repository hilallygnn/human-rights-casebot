--- CASE SUMMARY: S. and Marper v. UK (Article 8) ---
The core issue was the indefinite retention of fingerprints and DNA samples, even in cases where the suspect was acquitted or discharged. The Court ruled that the wholesale retention of this biometric data constitutes a disproportionate interference with the right to respect for private life (Article 8). The violation stems from the policy's failure to strike a fair balance between public security interests and the applicant's right to privacy. The blanket and indiscriminate nature of the power of retention had overstepped any acceptable margin of appreciation.

--- CASE SUMMARY: Ahmet Yıldırım v. Turkey (Article 10) ---
The case concerned the court order to block ALL access to Google Sites, which also hosted the applicant’s academic site, as a result of illegal content posted on another site. The Court found a violation of Article 10 (Freedom of Expression) because the measure was disproportionate. It constituted a form of 'wholesale blocking' of an entire communication channel rather than targeting the source of the unlawful content, rendering large amounts of legitimate information inaccessible.

--- CASE SUMMARY: Brambilla and Others v. Italy (Article 10) ---
The case involved the criminal conviction of journalists for actively intercepting confidential police radio communications to obtain information more rapidly. The Court found no violation of Article 10 (Freedom to receive information), observing that the conviction was based solely on the unlawful possession and use of interception equipment, which was necessary to prevent disorder and crime. The journalists' actions contravened criminal law prohibiting the interception of conversations not addressed to them.

--- CASE SUMMARY: Kaboğlu and Oran v. Turkey (Article 8) ---
Academics were subjected to verbal attacks and threats of physical harm following their report on minority rights. The domestic courts dismissed their claims. The Court found a violation of Article 8 (Right to Respect for Private Life) because the authorities failed to take effective steps to investigate the threats, thus neglecting their **positive obligation** to ensure a minimum level of protection for the applicants' personal integrity against hate speech and threats of violence.

--- CASE SUMMARY: Roman Zakharov v. Russia (Article 8) ---
The case addressed the legality and scope of secret mass surveillance and interception of mobile phone communications by state authorities. The Court found a violation of Article 8 because the domestic legal framework was inadequate, lacking sufficient safeguards against arbitrariness and abuse, particularly concerning the wholesale technical ability of authorities to intercept all mobile communications without prior judicial authorisation. The law did not meet the "quality of law" requirement.
