Case: McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom
Article: 2 (Right to Life)
Summary: This case concerned the killing of three suspected IRA members by British security forces in Gibraltar in 1988. The Court held that the United Kingdom had violated Article 2 because the operation was not planned or controlled to minimize the risk to life, even though the soldiers had not acted with the intent to kill unlawfully.
